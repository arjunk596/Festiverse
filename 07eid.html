            <h2>Tales of Tradition</h2>
            <p>In the city of Medina, after the Prophet Muhammad and his followers settled, they were instructed by Allah to observe the holy month of Ramadan—a time of fasting from dawn to sunset. Muslims spent the month in prayer, reflection, charity, and self-discipline, growing closer to Allah and developing empathy for the poor.
                As the month of Ramadan came to an end, the Prophet Muhammad announced that a day of joy and celebration would follow. This day, known as Eid-ul-Fitr, would be a time to break the fast, give thanks for completing the fast, and come together as a community.
                The Prophet instructed his followers to give Zakat al-Fitr, a charity to help the poor, and to celebrate by wearing their best clothes, sharing meals, and offering prayers in congregation. After the prayer, Muslims greeted each other with "Eid Mubarak," meaning "Blessed Eid."
                Eid-ul-Fitr became a day of unity, joy, and charity—a reminder to appreciate Allah's blessings and support the less fortunate. It continues to be celebrated worldwide as a time of festivity, family, and compassion.
